Pulse - Heartbeat API Example Plugin
=====

# What is Pulse?

Pulse by [Jeffikus](http://jeffikus.com/ "Jeffikus") is an example plugin for the Heartbeat API! It is a starting point for building your Heartbeat functionality into your WordPress powered application or plugin.

The plugin basically does the following:

* Outputs console data for a logged in user - the object will state that the user is logged in - [Console Screenshot](http://d.pr/i/22H6 "Console Screenshot")
* Outputs console data for a non logged in user - the object will state that the user is not logged in - [Console Screenshot](http://d.pr/i/cCCs "Console Screenshot")

# Why on Github and not WordPress.org

[WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress") is where your finished plugins should go (assuming they are free) - while this plugin doesn't actually perform any function or add value on its own - you need to make the magic happen :-)

The main reason for hosting it on Github is so you can easily fork it for your own projects, and send pull requests for updates/suggestions!

# What can I do with Heartbeat?

There are loads of possibilities;

* Chat applications,
* Notifications on the frontend,
* Manipulation of the DOM based on events happening in the CMS backend,
* And generally all types of (near) real-time functionality.
